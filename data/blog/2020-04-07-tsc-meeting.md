On Monday, 6 April 2020, the Technical Steering Committee for the Laminas
Project held its second monthly meeting. An agenda was crowd-sourced amongst the
TSC members prior to the meeting, and the meeting was held in the Laminas Slack.

[You can find the minutes in the TSC repository.](https://github.com/laminas/technical-steering-committee/blob/master/meetings/minutes/2020-04-06-TSC-Minutes.md)

A brief summary of decisions follows.

<!--- EXTENDED -->

- The TSC voted to accept four new members to the committee:
  [Abdul Malik Ikhsan (@samsonasik)](https://github.com/samsonasik),
  [Luís Cobucci (@lcobucci)](https://github.com/lcobucci),
  [Maximilian Bösing (@boesing)](https://github.com/boesing), and
  [Witold Wasiczko (@snapshotpl)](https://github.com/snapshotpl).
  Congratulations, and welcome!

- We voted to adopt a new package, [laminas/laminas-cli](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-cli),
  which provides scaffolding based on a PSR-11 container for exposing
  symfony/console commands.  This approach will simplify and standardize
  exposing commands in individual components.

- We voted to adopt the [laminas-tutorials](https://github.com/laminas-tutorials)
  GitHub organization, and use it as a place to both create demo applications as
  well as tutorials based on them.

- We voted to adopt the [RFC for providing Opcache Preloading tooling](https://discourse.laminas.dev/t/rfc-opache-preloading-for-mezzio-and-mvc/1442).

- We clarified how we will handle security issues for the near future.

- We made some decisions to reduce the amount of cross-posting from our forums
  to our Slack.
