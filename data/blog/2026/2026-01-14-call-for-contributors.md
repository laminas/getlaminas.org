# Why you should contribute

## Personal Skill Development

One of the best reasons to contribute to an open-source project is **personal skill development**.
You have the opportunity to work with real-world codebases which may be more complex than your personal projects.
We employ a workflow that encourages best practices like code reviews, testing, documentation, and collaboration.
Even if you aren't versed in PHP, Laminas, or Mezzio, it's a chance to work with a new language, framework (or microframework), and architectural patterns.
All of these contribute to making you a more effective programmer.

## Career and Résumé Benefits

This applies more to you experienced programmers out there.
So you know your way around PHP, but want to let the PHP community know you exist.
Contributing to Laminas and Mezzio is a good way to put yourself on the map.
Then you can **include the experience in your résumé** or even brag on programming forums that you wrote a section of code.
It's definitive proof that you have initiative, teamwork, and problem-solving skills which are highly valued by employers in the industry.

## Community and Networking

Laminas and Mezzio have skilled maintainers from around the world.
By contributing to our components, you get to **collaborate with us directly**.
Mentorship often happens naturally through code reviews and discussions, even if it's not formally structured.
By joining our contributors, you become part of a community that promotes the sharing of knowledge.
This is beneficial for both programmers who implement the tools and the codebase that is improved as a result of your hard work.

## Improved Software Quality

Whether you are **fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving the documentation**, you can be sure that the codebase will benefit from your contributions.
Open-source software thrives on collective improvement from regular programmers just like you.
The code maintainers will, of course, check your proposed updates thoroughly, so we can all benefit from quality code in our projects that are based on Laminas and Mezzio.

## You Influence Development

If a component doesn't have a feature you find useful in your projects, go ahead and propose its implementation.
Contributors **shape a project's roadmap and priorities**.
The end result is that you improve tools you personally use, so ultimately your own workflow benefits from your open-source contributions.
If a feature is approved, it's likely going to be beneficial for other implementers as well.

## Deeper Understanding of Software

If you are already using Laminas components and the Mezzio microframework, this part is for you.
You know how tools are used.
The next step is to look under the hood for a better understanding of design decisions, trade-offs, performance and security considerations.
This is your chance to **learn why things are done**, not just how.

## More than just code

It might seem intimidating to join a community of experienced developers who are already working with PHP, Laminas, and Mezzio for years, but documentation contributions are equally important as code.
As a user of Laminas or Mezzio, you are in a unique position to offer insight on where docs don't provide enough guidance or assume too much knowledge, for example.
We welcome developers of all experience levels, and you will find us to be a friendly and inclusive community.

# How can I contribute
