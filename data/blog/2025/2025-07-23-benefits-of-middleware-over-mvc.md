The traditional **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** is a tried and tested paradigm that has been used successfully in the past.
Recent industry shifts and practical challenges in real-life projects have led to the decline of MVC which is now seen as an obsolete architecture.
On the other hand, **middleware** is a high-level architecture that can offer several advantages to MVC, based on your application and development workflow.

<!--- EXTENDED -->

PHP works with request and response combos since it's based on the HTTP protocol.
Similarly, middleware perform actions based on the request and either completes the response or passes delegation on to the next middleware in the queue (middleware pipeline).
Below we will explore several aspects where **middleware is superior to MVC** and why it's a good idea to migrate to it.

## Flexibility and Modularity

- The middleware architecture is built on a modular approach, since each middleware is designed to handle a specific task, often independent of others.
- It is easier to modify or extend the request/response flow than for MVC.
- Middleware tends to adhere to PHP standards like PSR-7, PSR-15, PSR-17 defined by the [PHP Framework Interop Group](https://www.php-fig.org/).

All of these lead to building a code base that is cleaner and more easily maintainable in the long run.

## Scalability

The modularity of the middleware architecture **promotes scalability**.
Middleware code can be executed by using load balancers, reverse proxies and edge servers.
Modern middleware stacks often support asynchronous execution which can be used for concurrent requests while reducing the number of threads or resources per request.
For this reason, middleware is recommended for microservices or serverless architectures, where different middleware components can be deployed independently of one another.

## Reduced Complexity

Again, due to the modularity of middleware, the **complexity of the codebase can be reduced** compared to MVC.
Middleware components can be simpler and more focused on a given task, which promotes readability and maintenance even in complex platforms.

## Performance

While MVC expects each step of its flow to return something because of its controller/action flow, middleware can **finish a request-response task faster** in certain conditions.
For example, if a certain middleware can fully handle a request, it can return the response early, reducing execution time and lowering hardware requirements.
The **optional view rendering** also helps execution time for middleware, while MVC loads e.g. controller factories, view helpers, translation services and plugins even if you only need a JSON response.

## Enhanced Control Over Request Handling

The **flow** of your application (pipeline) can be much **easier to edit** without rewriting a bunch of code.
You can **inspect, modify or reject requests** at various points in the pipeline.
This is particularly handy when processing a request that is dependent on logging, authentication and authorization.

## Middleware Chains

Middleware chains are additional benefits resulting from middleware modularity and enhanced control.
They can **process a request in a predefined sequence**.
This is useful for **implementing complex processing logic**, like data processing, logging and authentication in a clean and manageable way.

## Asynchronous Processing

Middleware architectures can help you handle asynchronous processing, which is nowadays increasingly important for **building high-performance web applications**.
A good example for this scenario is when you need to manage many concurrent connections, while allowing other parts of the application to run in the meantime.
The downside is that this adds complexity and overhead in the code logic and error handling, making it harder to debug and test, but it can provide benefits in specific cases.

## Better Suited for API-First Development

**MVC is tightly coupled** to the web/MVC context which **difficult to reuse or test** your logic in CLI scripts, workers or other applications.
**Middleware** can often be a **better fit for API-first development**, where the main interaction with the application is through APIs rather than traditional web pages.
This is the recommended approach for handling different types of requests, such as RESTful APIs, GraphQL and WebSocket connections.

## Framework Lock-in

MVC has multiple **components tied to the framework**:

- Request & response classes.
- Routing system.
- Controllers or service containers.
- Lifecycle.

Conversely, **middleware is reusable** across currently active frameworks with little or no changes thanks to:

- **Implementing standards** like PSR-7 and PSR-11 which also helps **integrate with future PHP frameworks** that implement them.
- **Decoupling of handlers** which means they **can be used by API, CLI, worker processes or unit tests** without modification and while not being dependent on HTTP requests, routes, frameworks or controllers.
- **View rendering is optional or external**, since middleware cares about HTTP requests and responses, not about how they are rendered.
- The **middleware pipeline**, like the one based on PSR-15, **improves flexibility, customizability and testability** for execution flows.
- **Easier unit testing** without bootstrapping the framework thanks to middleware being small, self-contained, and decoupled from the full framework environment.

## Implementing migrations

One of the most beneficial advantages of middleware versatility is that it enables you to **migrate your codebase progressively**.
We all know that migrations can be costly and labor-intensive, but middleware allows you to perform the migration one component at a time, **with little to no disruption** to the overall platform functionality.
Basically, the old system is kept in place, while the components are replaced with new implementations using middleware.

This approach enables breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable and easily testable pieces.
It's called the **strangle strategy** (or strangler pattern).
It's a technique used to gradually replace a legacy system with a new one without doing a full rewrite all at once.

A complex migration is thus turned into a **series of manageable tasks** that can be handled by **smaller teams of developers**.
Its costs can be more easily controlled and spread out over a more reasonable period, which is likely going to be appreciated by investors.

## When Is a Migration Mandatory?

More often than not, the migration to a newer architecture is optional, especially if you have the resources to keep your legacy system functional.
But what if you must conform to a security framework that details how to secure customer data from various vulnerabilities?
Security frameworks may reject old architectures once they are no longer maintained or at the very least will promote the adoption of more modern and robust approaches.

Modern approaches tend to include:

- **Continuous verification** for all requests, whether internal or external.
- **Least privilege**, meaning the users are allowed the minimum level of access for their specific tasks.
- **Microsegmentation** to isolate components with the aim to limit the impact of breaches.
- **Strong authentication and authorization** using robust methods.

Normally, it's a task in itself to adapt systems to conform to security frameworks like [SOC 2](https://soc2.co.uk/) by being well-maintained, flexible and by implementing secure coding practices.
These tasks are often easier to perform on newer systems built on active components.

## Conclusions

In summary, while MVC is still a powerful and proven architecture currently in use by many web applications, the middleware alternative offers additional advantages for modularity, scalability and performance in specific application requirements.
