Nowadays, applications are getting more and more complex.
The classic way of executing sequential code, from **request to response**, still works for simple apps, but using a modern architecture has many benefits.
Enter the **middleware**, an intermediary code that processes the request in various ways before it even reaches your custom code.

<!--- EXTENDED -->

In this article we will list the advantages of using middlewares in your applications.
From maintainability, to future-proof design, the benefits can't be ignored.

### What does middleware do?

The versatility of middleware is virtually endless.

- Do you need it to pre-process your request by validating the user session or the form input?
- Do you need to cache or translate the request?
- Do you need to contact a third party site to enhance the request?

Your custom middleware can handle **any specific logic** your application may require.
Some useful things to implement are error handling, CORS, routing, translating.

Ultimately, you can split your application into multiple middlewares that process the request before it reaches your main code.
An added benefit is that the middlewares can be **reused more easily** in other applications.
Even better, the middlewares **don't need to be written in the same programming language** or coding architecture.

The alternative to the middleware architecture is the MVC architecture which has grown considerably since its inception, is feature rich, modular and reusable.
Instead of using flexible layers like a middleware, MVC revolves around controllers and actions.
Unfortunately, MVC's complexity has brought about its downfall, though it is still being used.
The important bit and the central difference to middleware is that in a MVC, a request targets a single controller.
Nowadays, the aim is more toward lightweight, modular and standardized frameworks for producing microframeworks and API based solutions which are more suited to a middleware approach.

### How do you set up a middleware pipeline?

The **middleware pipeline** defines the sequence in which the middlewares are executed.
Setting up the pipeline needs to be done with care to avoid unwanted behavior.
In some cases, the execution of one middleware can affect another middleware because of the way the request is passed along.
The main things to consider when setting up the pipeline are:

- Security
- Performance
- Functionality

For example, it makes sense to add an error handler early in the pipeline, even as the first entry.
If your application requires the user to be logged in, it doesn't make sense to process the request before the authentication middleware gives the go-ahead.
Also, it doesn't make sense to have an authorization middleware placed before an authentication middleware in the pipeline.

Based on the future needs of your application, the **pipeline can be easily updated** to include additional middleware.
This aspect goes a long way toward making the flow of your application easier to understand and debug.
After all, debugging and maintaining smaller sections of code is easier than working with a monolith.

### When and how is middleware executed?

Like the name suggests, **middlewares are executed between the request and the server response** handled by your main codebase.
The classic way of handling a request meant running through a sequence of code that is less adaptive.
That is, unless you add a bunch of `if-else` statements for all the cases where the execution needs to exit prematurely.

And here is where middleware shines.
There are two main ways the middleware handles its input:

- It **passes control** to the next middleware in the pipeline.
- It **terminates the request** and generates a response of its own.

Normally, the execution passes through the pipeline, one middleware at a time, until the execution is passed to your main codebase which generates a response.
From than point on, the execution passes through the same middlewares in reverse order, all the way to displaying the result to the user.

Based on your pipeline, the execution can end sooner and generate a relevant response, like an exception, before it reaches your main codebase.
This is a more efficient way of handling the request in certain use cases and should result in shorter response times.
The response in this case is generated by the middleware where the execution ended.

As an example, let's say that the user needs to be logged in before the system allows access.
If your pipeline has an authentication middleware, it can return an exception that redirects the user to the login page.

### Standardizing the architecture

The aim of standards is to make systems interoperable, to make code easier to read and understand, and in general to improve developers' workflow.
[The PHP Framework Interop Group](https://www.php-fig.org/) has been working diligently on defining standards for using PHP effectively.
They have also defined recommendations for higher-level architecture, like the use of `handlers` together with `middleware` which interests us for the purpose of this article.

[PSR-15](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/) defines the mechanism for processing a [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) request and producing a response.
PSR-15 mentions interfaces that must be implemented for the handler and the middlewares, as well as the recommended way to process responses and exceptions.

### Overview of middleware benefits

We already mentioned these in the sections above, but here are the benefits in an easier-to-read list:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each middleware handles a single task like logging, authentication and error handling.
- **Reusability**: Middlewares are reusable in other applications.
- **Customizable**: Your custom middleware can contain any specific logic your application needs.
- **Sequential Execution**: Middleware code is executed in the sequence defined in the middleware pipeline.
- **Expandability**: The middleware pipeline can be edited to include more middlewares without affecting existing processes.
- **Improved request handling**: Each middleware can either pass control to the next middleware in the pipeline or terminate the request.
- **Standardization**: This applies mostly to middlewares that follow a given standard, like PSR-15, which makes the application architecture more consistent and easier to understand.
