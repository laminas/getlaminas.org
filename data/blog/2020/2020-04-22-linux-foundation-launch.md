Today, the [Linux Foundation formally announced that it now hosts the Laminas
Project](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/linux-foundation-fosters-laminas-community)!

[Our charter](https://github.com/laminas/technical-steering-committee/blob/master/CHARTER.md)
became effective on March 24, 2020.

This also means that you can now [donate to the project via
CommunityBridge](https://funding.communitybridge.org/projects/laminas-project).
Our goal is to raise enough money initially to help fund somebody to work
part-time on the project.

As our various worldwide economies begin opening up following the COVID-19
outbreak, we will also renew our search for entities interested in funding via a
corporate membership model, which will help provide funding longevity to the
project.

A huge thank you everybody who has helped make this step in the project's
evolution possible!
