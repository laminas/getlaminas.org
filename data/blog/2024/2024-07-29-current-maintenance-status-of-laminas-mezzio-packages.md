The Laminas Project has created a large number of packages to serve the needs of the PHP community.
But what happens when you need to make sure that the package you want to use in your application is being actively
maintained?
Sure, you can check each package manually, but the most useful thing would be a full overview of this vital
information.

### Laminas and Mezzio packages maintenance status at a glance

The page below intends to provide exactly that - a fast, accessible way to examine every package at a glance. It
contains columns for each subproject: Mezzio, Laminas Components, Laminas MVC and API Tools. The page automatically
refreshes the package status daily, is sorted alphabetically and is publicly available.

### The best way to stay up-to-date

Laminas and Mezzio packages are constantly in motion.
This page allows you to regularly check the packages you chose for your project and make sure they are still reliable.
If the status of a package changes from `active` to `maintenance-only`, `security-only` or is discontinued, you can
quickly see it and take action.
The handy link to the relevant Technical Steering Committee minute file details the reason for the status change and a
recommended solution for moving forward.
