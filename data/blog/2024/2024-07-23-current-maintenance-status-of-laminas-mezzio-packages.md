The Laminas Project has created a large number of packages to serve the needs of the PHP community.
But what happens when you need to make sure that the package you want to use in your application is being actively
maintained?
Sure, you can check each package manually, but the most useful thing would be a full overview of this vital
information.

### Laminas and Mezzio packages maintenance status at a glance

The page below intends to provide exactly that - a fast, accessible way to examine every package at a glance. It
contains columns for each of the three organizations: Laminas, Mezzio and Api Tools. The page automatically refreshes
the package status daily, is sorted alphabetically and is publicly available.

### Stay vigilant!

Things are constantly in motion, though, so you need to check on this page regularly to make sure that the packages you
chose for your project are still reliable. If the status of a package changes from active to `maintenance-only`,
`security-only` or is `discontinued`, you can quickly see it and take action.
The handy link to the relevant Technical Steering Committee minute file details the reason for the status change and a
recommended solution for moving forward.
