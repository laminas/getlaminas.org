# getlaminas.org

Source code for the getlaminas.org website.

## Testing

First, create a `.env` file in the root directory with contents similar to the
following:

```env
RELEASE_FEED_TOKEN=aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffffgggg0000
```

Next, use the provided [docker-compose configuration](docker-compose.yml):

```bash
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
# browse to http://localhost:8080
```

## Testing CSS

The above commands will launch the application. If you want to work on CSS
during that time, you will need to have node, npm, and gulp installed on your
host machine. Once they are:

```bash
# Because files are copied from the container, we need to make them writable:
$ sudo chmod a+rw data/assets.json public/css/*.css
# Now we can install dependencies and start watching for changes:
$ cd bootstrap
$ npm i
$ gulp
```

From there, any changes to CSS will be propagated to the application, and
reloading the page in the browser will show the changes.

Alternately, you can use the following command to rebuild the base docker
container:

```bash
$ docker-compose build php
```
