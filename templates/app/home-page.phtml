                across the PHP ecosystem, with an emphasis on the Enterprise
                market. It has formed the basis of numerous business
                applications and services including eCommerce platforms,
                content management, healthcare systems, entertainment platforms
                and portals, messaging services, APIs, and many others.

                The Linux Foundation is host to a range of widely successful open source
                projects, and has led many similar transitions in the past. We believe that by
                moving Zend Framework to this proven governance model, it will enjoy both growth
                in adoption and contributors, and it will continue to focus on delivering best
                of breed innovative code, using the highest standards of security, transparency,
                and quality.

            <h2 class="text-primary">About Laminas and its governance</h2>

            <p>
                In spinning the project into its own foundation, we need to differentiate the
                Open Source project from the commercial Zend brand, which means a new name!
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Laminas</strong> is the plural of <strong>lamina</strong>,
                meaning <em>a thin layer</em>. We feel it succinctly summarizes the goals of
                the project in many ways:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Components you can compose or <em>layer</em> into any application.</li>
                <li>Middleware architectures are often termed <em>layered</em>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The project will encompass each of the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The various standalone components.</li>
                <li>The MVC framework.</li>
                <li>The Apigility subproject.</li>
                <li>The Expressive subproject.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Governance</h2>

            <p>
                The project will be led by a Governing Board, responsible for
                the business decisions, and a Technical Steering Committee
                (TSC), responsible for the technical decisions.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Technical Steering Committee will initially be composed by current members
                of the Zend Framework Community Review Team, along with other folks who are
                helping us during the transition. Its role will be to make decisions about what
                we maintain, what milestones to work on, who has commit access to specific
                repositories, and the general technical direction of the project.

                <p>
                    The Governing Board will consist of representatives from member
                    companies, as well as one or more TSC members. The Board will
                    be responsible for establishing the governance structure and
                    general project oversight including business decisions,
                    budgets, organizing events and working groups, providing
                    marketing support to the project, and handling IP or legal
                    issues as they arise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project will also eventually include a small team of
                    developers to help lead the day-to-day maintenance, manage
                    automation, keep the web presence online, and other tasks
                    necessary to keeping the project going. This team will help
                    provide project continuity, allowing contributors to focus on the
                    contributions they care about most.
                </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
            <h2 class="text-primary">What will happen to the code?</h2>

            <p>
                Components and the MVC code will move to a new Laminas organization under
                GitHub. Apigility packages will move from the zfcampus organization to the
                Apigility organization. Expressive packages will move to a new Expressive
                organization.
            </p>

            <p>
                The existing code will all be archived. This means it will remain available on
                GitHub, but will be read-only; this will allow existing installations to
                continue working without interruption, but clearly signal that development has
                moved to the new project. The related package entries on Packagist will each be
                marked as deprecated, and point to the relevant new Laminas package as an
                alternative.
            </p>

            <p>
                All packages published by the project will be marked as <em>replacements</em> of the
                existing Zend Framework packages, and will include tools to alias legacy classes
                to the new package classes. This will allow for seamless integration in existing
                projects, including when using third-party libraries that leverage ZF code.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, we will be providing tools both to update your own code to use the new
                classes provided by Laminas packages, as well as to help you update your
                dependencies to use the new Laminas packages instead of the Zend Framework
                versions. This latter will likely be accomplished via a
                <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a> plugin to help automate the transition.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Timeline</h2>

            <p>
                Much of the transition is well under way at this point with domains secured,
                GitHub organizations created, initial sponsorship commitments in place, and
                migration tooling being tested. Our hope is to be operational within Q2 or Q3 of
                this year (2019); the timeline will be based on how quickly we can secure
                sponsorship commitments for the foundation.
