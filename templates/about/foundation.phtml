                across the PHP ecosystem, with an emphasis on the Enterprise
                market. It has formed the basis of numerous business
                applications and services including eCommerce platforms,
                content management, healthcare systems, entertainment platforms
                and portals, messaging services, APIs, and many others.

                transitioning to this proven governance model will help us both grow
                in adoption and contributors, and allow us to focus on delivering best
                of breed innovative code, using the highest standards of security, transparency,

                project model, which will entail an additional Governing Board to manage
                marketing the project, funding development, developing partnerships, and more.

            <h2>About Laminas and its governance</h2>
            
            <p>
                In spinning the project into its own foundation, we needed to differentiate the
                Open Source project from the commercial Zend brand, which has meant new names!
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Laminas</strong> is the plural of <strong>lamina</strong>,
                meaning <em>a thin layer</em>. We feel it succinctly summarizes the goals of
                the project in many ways:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Components you can compose or <em>layer</em> into any application.</li>
                <li>Middleware architectures are often termed <em>layered</em>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The project will encompass each of the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The various standalone components.</li>
                <li>The MVC framework.</li>
                <li>The Apigility subproject, which becomes <strong>Laminas API Tools</strong>.</li>
                <li>The Expressive subproject, which becomes <strong>Mezzio</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Governance</h2>

            <p>
                The project is currently led by its <a href="<?= $this->url('about.tsc') ?>">
                Technical Steering Committee</a> (TSC). The TSC makes all
                project-related decisions at this time, ranging from technical
                to marketing and funding.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Technical Steering Committee's primary role is to make
                decisions about what we maintain, what milestones to work on,
                who has commit access to specific repositories, and the general
                technical direction of the project.
            </p>

            <p>
                When we are able to move forward as a funded project through the
                Linux Foundation, the project will have two governance bodies: the TSC, and a
                Governing Board.  The TSC will continue to be responsible for technical
                decisions, but the Governing Board will take over business and marketing
                decisions for the project.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Governing Board will consist of representatives from member
                companies, as well as one or more TSC members. The Board will
                be responsible for establishing the governance structure and
                general project oversight including business decisions,
                budgets, organizing events and working groups, providing
                marketing support to the project, and handling IP or legal
                issues as they arise. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The project will also eventually include a small team of
                developers to help lead the day-to-day maintenance, manage
                automation, keep the web presence online, and other tasks
                necessary to keeping the project going. This team will help
                provide project continuity, allowing contributors to focus on the
                contributions they care about most.
            </p>

        <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
            <h2>What has happened to Zend Framework?</h2>

            <p>
                All Zend Framework components, including the MVC runtime, has
                moved to a new <a href="https://github.com/laminas">Laminas organization under
                GitHub</a>. Apigility packages have moved from the zfcampus organization to the
                <a href="https://github.com/laminas-api-tools">Laminas API Tools organization</a>.
                Expressive packages have moved to the <a href="https://github.com/mezzio">Mezzio
                organization</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The existing repositories have all been archived. This means it will remain available on
                GitHub, but will be read-only; this allows existing installations to
                continue working without interruption, while clearly signal that development has
                moved to the new projects. The related package entries on Packagist have been
                marked as deprecated, and point to the relevant new packages as
                alternatives.
            </p>

            <p>
                All new packages published by the Laminas Project have been marked as <em>replacements</em> of the
                existing Zend Framework packages, and includes tools for aliasing legacy classes
                to the new package classes. This allows for seamless integration in existing
                projects, including when using third-party libraries that leveraged ZF code.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, we have provided tools both to update your own code to use the new
                classes provided by Laminas packages, as well as to help you update your
                dependencies to use the new Laminas packages instead of the Zend Framework
                versions. These are provided as a combination of a 
                <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a> plugin,
                configuration post-processors for MVC and Mezzio applications, and the <a
                href="https://github.com/laminas/laminas-migration">laminas-migration</a> tool.
