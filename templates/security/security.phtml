            <p>
                The Laminas Project takes security seriously. If we verify a reported
                security vulnerability, our policy is:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    We will patch the current release branch, as well as the
                    immediate prior minor release branch.
                </li>

                <li>
                    After patching the release branches, we will immediately
                    issue new security fix releases for each patched release
                    branch.
                </li>

                <li>
                    A security advisory will be released on the Laminas Project
                    site detailing the vulnerability, as well as
                    recommendations for end-users to protect themselves.
                    Security advisories will be listed at
                    <a href="<?= $this->url('security.pages', ['action' => 'advisories']) ?>"><?= $this->serverurl($this->url('security.pages', ['action' => 'advisories'])) ?></a>,
                    as well as via a <a href="<?= $this->url('security.pages', ['action' => 'feed']) ?>">feed</a>
                    (which is also present in the website head for easy feed discovery)
